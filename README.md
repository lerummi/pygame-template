# pygame-template

A template for developing Pygame applications that can run in the browser using pygbag (Pygame WebAssembly).

## Overview

This project provides a complete development environment for creating Pygame games that run both natively and in web browsers. It includes Docker and devcontainer configurations for consistent development across different machines.

## Features

- **Python 3.13** with modern tooling
- **uv** for fast dependency management
- **pygbag** for WebAssembly compilation
- **Docker Compose** setup for isolated development
- **VS Code devcontainer** support
- Pre-configured to avoid common pygbag/Docker pitfalls

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Start the server
docker compose up

# Access your game at http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Using VS Code Devcontainer / GitHub Codespaces

1. Open this project in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces
2. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (VS Code) or wait for Codespaces to finish setup
3. The server starts automatically in the background
4. A preview window will automatically open showing your game at http://localhost:8000
5. Server logs are visible in the Terminal output to monitor for errors

### Option 3: Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the game
uv run pygbag app

# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

## Project Structure

```

```

## How It Works

The Docker/devcontainer setup uses a workaround for pygbag in containerized environments:

1. **Build Phase**: `pygbag --build` generates static HTML/JS/WASM files
2. **Asset Download**: Required pygame wheel is downloaded from CDN
3. **Serve Phase**: Python's HTTP server serves files without URL rewriting

This avoids browser security issues where pygbag's proxy would rewrite CDN URLs to use `0.0.0.0`, which browsers block.

## Development

Edit `app/main.py` to modify your game. The template includes a simple red square that you can move with arrow keys.

### With Docker Compose

After editing code:
```bash
docker compose restart
```

### With Devcontainer / GitHub Codespaces

The server automatically watches for file changes and rebuilds your game. Simply:
1. Edit your code in `app/main.py`
2. Save the file
3. Refresh your browser to see changes
4. Monitor the Terminal for any errors or build output

### Local Development

Just refresh the browser - pygbag supports live reloading.

## Requirements

- **Docker**: For Docker Compose setup
- **VS Code**: For devcontainer support (optional)
- **Python 3.12+** and **uv**: For local development (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Browser shows "Downloading..." forever

- Make sure you're accessing `http://localhost:8000`, NOT `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Port 8000 already in use

```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Or change the port in docker-compose.yml:
ports:
  - "8080:8000"  # Use 8080 instead
```

### Container fails to start

```bash
# Rebuild without cache
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
